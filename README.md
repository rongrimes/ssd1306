# Raspberry Pi Pico with SPI SSD1306 display
This text in active devlopment: March 30, 2022

I had a new pico on my desktop along with an Adafruit SSD1306 OLED display unit, and the exercise was to the diplay unit to do pretty stuff.

## Inspiration:
The "hard" part of the code came from the guys in Delhi at techatronic (Hey, thanks guys!), with the base SPI and device driver code.
